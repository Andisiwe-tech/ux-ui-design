<p>Burgeris a dellicious dish consisting of fillings-usually a patty of ground meat,typically beef- placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. the patties often served with cheesse, lettuce,tomato, onions, bacon with condiments such as mastard, mayonnaise and others.</p>
 <p>Burger is super special to me as a dish, because of the softiness in it and that juicy spark from its condiments, and with the patties which the burger consists makes it super tastey and enjoyable to me.</p>  
  <p>Version of the meal have been served forover a century, but its origins are still unclear. The 1758 edition of the book <strong>The Art of Cookery Made in Plain and Easy</strong> by <m> Hnnah Glasses</m> included a recipe called "Hamburgh sausages", suggesting that it should be served 'roasted with toasted bread under it'. </p>
